Until finding a site really making it simple, disqus and its own instructions didn't really make much sense,
after following the information on [https://desiredpersona.com/disqus-comments-jekyll/](https://desiredpersona.com/disqus-comments-jekyll/) and afterwards actually understanding it, it did make sense.
And obviously also worked flawless.
