I fought a bit with understanding Disqus as a solution for blog-post commenting, since I really couldn't quite understand the instructions provided by Disqus themselfs, or its pre-generated code.

Especially since Jekyll provides a template to add comments to posts already at start, I figured it would be easy, but if you don't provide some additional settings, it won't work.

So until finding a site that really made it simple it was a little bit annoying, but after following the information on [https://desiredpersona.com/disqus-comments-jekyll/](https://desiredpersona.com/disqus-comments-jekyll/) and afterwards actually understanding it, it did make sense.
And obviously also worked flawless.
