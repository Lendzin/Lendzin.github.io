I can really see the point in pre-compiling CSS, since adding CSS to a bunch of diffrent pages could definetly be an issue on a bigger project, there's just too many files to edit and too much code to write, being able to bunch things up and add small incriments with math statements, or even use if-statements - this and the fact that you can use variables seems more useful and less clutterly than regular CSS.

That's all good on the PRO side of the preprocessing, but on the CON side, it obviously also makes quick changes hard to make, adding steps to every update, and its impossible to do without re-compiling the whole site every time. (unless you change whats already compiled, but then you dont get the changes in your preprocessesed site, and thus must make double changes anyway eventually.)

Using something like SASS like here on this little jekyll blog does make it a little bit more managable, but I don't really see that I've gotten enough experience with this little thing to make a huge statement on its usability,since it also seem to add some other complications. 
And to be honest, I haven't really seen a use for anything except normal CSS for this site, since its a SSG-blog.

But the future will tell more of that.
