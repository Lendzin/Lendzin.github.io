As far as I can understand, SSG's is all good and well for smaller projects, up to somewhere in the medium bracket, and I've read that it can also be made to work for bigger sites with up to 2000+ pages, but the more pages you have, thge more complications that in time would require alot of extra solutions and content packages to avoid extreme generation-times. (waiting 3 hours to change a headline on a page isn't really worth it).
So, I guess its a valid thing to have, but I guess it starts getting questionable when you go into the bigger sites, even though, if someone's already done something, using their information obviously makes it more plausible for the next person - so, without actually working on a big project with it, I, as someone studying, wouldn't really be the one answering that question.
